## Project description

This project was developed as part of my thesis work. It is a web application designed to support the secondary clothing market by providing a platform where registered users can sell and purchase clothing items. The platform offers essential features such as managing users' items, filtering and searching on the shopping page, and maintaining a list of favorite items. Initially, the project is localized for the Estonian market.
